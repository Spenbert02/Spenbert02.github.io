In this work, we provide a toolpath generation algorithm for 3D printing along specified 3D vector fields. Given an input boundary surface and internal vector field, our procedure is capable of generating a non-interfering, uniformly spaced toolpath sequence that can be fed to a 3D printer as Gcode for 3D printing. A primary use case is fiber-oriented bioprinting. We demonstrate the feasability of our procedure by 3D bioprinting a silicone human left ventricle model from a manually segmented diffusion MRI scan and an internal primary myofiber orientation field.
