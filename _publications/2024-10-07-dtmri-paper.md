Further developing the algorithm proposed in my undergraduate thesis, we have developed a generalizable, freeform 3D field-guided toolpathing procedure for 3D printing. We demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm by recreating a human left ventricle, obtained from a segmented diffusion MRI scan of a human heart, in silicone. We plan to publish by the end of 2024.
