This was a year-round research project in the McAlpine Lab at the University of Minnesota that I worked on during my sophomore year and the summer afterwards. FisnarRobotPlugin is a plugin for Cura, Ultimaker's 3D printing slicing software. FisnarRobotPlugin implements user-interfaces, toolpath planning, and serial communication procedures to coordinate pneumatic dispensers and 3-axis Fisnar brand gantry peripherals for real-time manual control, pick-and-place procedures, and high-precision 3D printing of arbitrary geometries. After going through Ultimaker's code review process, FisnarRobotPlugin was published to the Ultimaker Marketplace, where it has amassed over 7,000 downloads (listing found <a href="https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins/Spenbert02/FisnarRobotPlugin" target="_blank">here</a>). Below is a silicone heart valve model with pluronic support material, 3D printed using FisnarRobotPlugin.
