I'm a staff researcher in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mcalpineresearchgroup/home" target="_blank">McAlpine Lab</a> of the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/me" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> department at the University of Minnesota. I graduated from the University of Minnesota in the spring of 2024, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. My interests lie in computational procedures surrounding 3D bioprinting, in particular toolpath generation procedures for bioprinting functional organoids possessing architectures derived from medical imaging of healthy tissue. The ultimate goal of tissue engineering is to fabricate full scale, functional, implantable organs that match the geometry, architecture and function of native tissue. I'm interested in using computational tools and techniques to push the field closer to this goal. Use the navigation bar above to check out some of my previous projects and experiences.
