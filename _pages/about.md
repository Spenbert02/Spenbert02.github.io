I'm a Researcher 2 in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mcalpineresearchgroup/home" target="_blank">McAlpine Lab</a>, <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/me" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> department at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>. I graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from the University of Minnesota in the spring of 2024, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in biomedical geometric computing.
