I'm an incoming PhD student to the <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/people.html">Geometric Computing Lab</a> in the Courant Institute at NYU. I was previously a staff researcher and undergraduate assistant in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mcalpineresearchgroup/home">3D Printing Functional Materials and Devices Lab</a> in the mechanical engineering department at the University of Minnesota, where I completed my undergraduate degree, working on path planning for fiber-aligned 3D bioprinting. I'm interested in geometric and scientific computing with applications in biomedicine.
