I'm a Researcher 2 in the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/me" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> department at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>. I graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from the University of Minnesota in the spring of 2024, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I'm in my fourth year with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mcalpineresearchgroup/home" target="_blank">McAlpine Research Group</a>, where I've developed novel geometry processing algorithms for recapitulating complex cardiac topologies via medical imaging and 3D bioprinting. My research interests are centered around novel biomedically-oriented quantification, reconstruction, and simulation methods that open the door to fundamental biological insights, human organ engineering, and personalized medicine.
